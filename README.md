# Why?

- I am building this as a solo project for Scrimba, I want to test my skills without any help from videos only from google and my prior knowledge or notes.

# Hope to learn?

- I hope to learn how to better understand the basic functions of Javascript in a real-world project. Also, to sharpen my skills and memory of different strategies to write a shorter and quicker script.

# Reflection

This project was very challenging for me! I was forced to step outside of my comfort zone many times. This may resulted in spaghetti code. Some unexpected obstacles for me were referencing variables that were in scope, as opposed to global variables. My way around this was to have the entire code execute in one function. A new technology I used this time around was NODE NPM to run my SASS live. I used this instead of the extension in visual studio code because of NPM's real-world approach to what developers are using.
