# unit_converter_scrimba

unit converter solo project

# Why?

I am building this as a solo project for Scrimba, I want to test my skills without any help from videos only from google and my prior knowledge or notes.

# Hope to learn

I hope to learn how to better understand the basic functions of Javascript in a real-world project. Also, to sharpen my skills and memory of different strategies to write a shorter and quicker script.
